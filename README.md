# Procedural-Terrian-Generation
CSC3032-Dissertation Project-Unity  Newcastle University

This is the final dissertation project that I completed at the university. The aim of this project is to develop a procedural terrain generation in Unity engine, which allows user to automatically generate terrain of any random shapes, different textures, and infinite size in real-time. It is one of the core techniques in modern game development and helps developers create game contents in an automated way. The above document details differents features about how I used Noise to generate pseudorandom height maps, and how I created the chunk system to implement endless terrain and so on.
